# Data provenance and processing notes

## Genotype data

Source: AtPolyDB, `call_method_75` release, TAIR9 coordinates.

- Repository: <https://github.com/Gregor-Mendel-Institute/atpolydb>
- Archive: `call_method_75.tar.gz`, 92,088,117 bytes
- Table: 214,051 SNPs × 1,307 accessions
- Calls: A/C/G/T, homozygous inbred lines; no missing values
- Encoding: A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3 (`genotypes_all_1307.npy`, SNPs × accessions, uint8)

The minor allele is redefined within the 83 phenotyped accessions. Because all lines are inbred, a SNP has two observed alleles in this subset and the dosage is coded 0 or 1, not 0/1/2. SNPs with minor allele frequency ≤ 0.05 are excluded from prediction and association, leaving 202,747 SNPs.

The 1,307-accession matrix is used to define haplotype blocks, pretrain the graph encoder, and supply genotypes for the 29 external accessions. The 83-accession matrix is used to fit all phenotype models; the external-29 subset is used only for validation.

## Phenotype data

Source: AtPolyDB `phenotype_published_raw.tsv`; `8_Seed Dormancy` is DSDS50 in days, originally reported by Atwell et al. (2010).

- 83 accessions with non-missing DSDS50
- Range 0–189 days; median 36 days; mean 43.1 days
- Seven accessions with 0 days; one accession (Kas-2) with 189 days

The external set uses the `279_DSDS50` column. That column has 109 non-missing entries, 80 of which overlap the 83 accessions. The remaining 29 accessions are used as an exploratory external set. The two phenotype columns have a Spearman correlation of 0.792 on the 80 overlapping accessions, which supports rank transfer but does not make the measurements equivalent.

## Gene annotation

Source: TAIR10/Araport11 gene models.

- 27,445 protein-coding genes on chromosomes 1–5
- `data/annotations/genes_tair10.csv` contains chromosome, start, end, strand, gene identifier, short name and description
- SNPs were annotated with the nearest gene and with an inside-gene flag

SNP coordinates are TAIR9 and have not been lifted over. The coordinate consistency check in `scripts/03_annotate_snp_genes.py` found that 61.8% of SNPs fall inside a TAIR10 gene and 93.0% are within 5 kb of one. Key loci (DOG1, RGA and the chromosome 1 candidate region) were checked manually. A genome-wide coordinate offset of a few hundred base pairs cannot be excluded.

## Population structure

LD pruning used 100 kb windows and r² > 0.2, retaining 9,245 SNPs. The first five principal components explain 4.13%, 3.55%, 3.20%, 2.87% and 2.67% of the genotype variance. The VanRaden kinship matrix has a mean off-diagonal value of −0.010.

LD decays quickly in this panel: mean r² is 0.348 below 10 kb, 0.126 at 10–20 kb, 0.155 at 20–30 kb and 0.052 at 30–40 kb. The 20–30 kb bin is noisy because only 83 accessions are available.

## Haplotype blocks and graph

Blocks are consecutive runs of at most 25 SNPs, with a maximum span of 50 kb. The definition uses the 1,307 accessions, not the 83 phenotyped accessions, to avoid phenotype-dependent boundaries.

- 8,589 blocks
- Median span 11.5 kb; 90th percentile 21.8 kb
- Node features: mean minor-allele dosage plus the first three principal components of the within-block dosage matrix
- Principal-component signs are fixed by the SNP with the largest absolute loading

Edges:

- Adjacency between consecutive blocks on the same chromosome (8,584 edges)
- LD edges when the absolute correlation of block mean dosages is at least 0.5 and the genomic distance is at most 1 Mb; at most three strongest LD edges per block (3,008 edges)
- Mean absolute LD correlation of LD edges: 0.662

The undirected graph has 11,592 edges. For pretraining, edges are expanded in both directions, self-loops and a virtual node are added, giving 48,951 directed edges.

## Graph encoder and pretraining

The encoder is a two-layer edge-aware graph Transformer with hidden dimension 16, four attention heads and dropout 0.10. Edge features are normalized genomic distance, absolute LD correlation, and a one-hot edge type. A virtual node connects to every block.

Pretraining masks 15% of blocks in each accession and reconstructs the four block features from the remaining graph. The 1,307 accessions are split 1,176/131 into training and validation. Training uses AdamW, learning rate 3×10⁻³, cosine decay, weight decay 1×10⁻⁴, batch size 8 and 25 epochs. No phenotype is used.

The best validation MSE is 0.9052 and the final training MSE is 0.9056. The 83 phenotyped accessions are then encoded into an 83 × 8,589 × 16 block embedding; the 1,307-accession sample representation is 1,307 × 48 (mean, maximum and standard deviation of block embeddings).

## Prediction and association settings

Prediction uses kernel ridge regression in the GBLUP form. The SNP kernel is `XXᵀ/p` with p = 202,747. The block kernel is the average linear kernel of standardized block mean dosages. The graph kernel is the average linear kernel of standardized 16-dimensional block embeddings. The dual kernel is `0.5 K_SNP + 0.5 K_block`; the triple kernel gives equal weight to all three.

The outer loop is 5-fold cross-validation repeated 30 times. The inner loop selects the ridge parameter from 10⁻⁴ to 3 by 5-fold cross-validation within each training fold. Model comparisons use paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests over the 30 repeats.

The association model is an OLS null with intercept and PC1–5, fitted to standardized DSDS50. For each block, the score statistic is `Q = ||Zᵀr||²`, where Z is the residualized block genotype matrix and r is the residualized phenotype. P values use a Satterthwaite approximation to the mixture chi-square distribution with 77 residual degrees of freedom. The rotation null uses 1,000 draws from the orthogonal complement of the covariate space; the experiment-wide error rate is based on the minimum P value across blocks after standardization. BH q values are reported alongside the rotation results.
